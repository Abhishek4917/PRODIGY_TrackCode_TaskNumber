Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is a straightforward encryption method used in classical cryptography. It works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a set number of positions.

This project demonstrates how to implement Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption in [programming language], aiming to provide educational insights into basic cryptographic techniques.

Features

Encrypt Messages: Convert plaintext into ciphertext.
Decrypt Messages: Convert ciphertext back into plaintext.
Customizable Shift: Choose your own shift value (key) for encryption and decryption.
